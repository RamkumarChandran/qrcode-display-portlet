# QRCode Display Portlet

## Motivation
QRCodes are getting part of our lives day by day. ZXing has a quite good implementation on generating them, so I thought it could be a nice feature to have a portlet to add a QRCode to a page displayed by a portal.

## Goals of the project
This project's goal was to let the users to display the portal's URL, the current URL or a custom specified URL or Text in **QRCode** format on the portal pages.

Below there are some screenshots of the current portlet:
